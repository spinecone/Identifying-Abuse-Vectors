# What is an abuse vector?

An abuse vector is any feature of a website that can be used to harm someone. This can take the form of threats to a person's safety, communicating with someone who does not want to be communicated with, revealing of personal information, and many others. 

In general,  you can determine if a feature can be abused by asking these questions:

* Could this be used to hurt someone physically?
* Could this be used to hurt someone emotionally?
* Could this be used to damage someone's reputation?
* Could this be used to communicate with someone without their consent?
* Could this be used to show something \(text, images, etc.\) to someone without their consent?
* Could this be used to learn something about a person who hasn't consented to revealing this information?
