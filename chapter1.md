# What is an abuse vector?

An abuse vector is any feature of a website that can be used to harm someone. This can take the form of threats to a person's safety, communicating with someone who does not want to be communicated with, revealing of personal information, and many others.

There have been many high-profile cases of targeted online harassment against public figures, but it can happen to anyone, and has happened to an overwhelming number of people. According to a Pew Research survey conducted in 2017, roughly 4 in 10 Americans have personally experienced online harassment. While more men have experienced harassment than women \(44% of men and 37% of women\), roughly half \(53%\) of young women ages 18 to 29 say that someone has sent them explicit images they did not ask for. You can read more statistics from this survey at [http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/07/11/online-harassment-2017/](http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/07/11/online-harassment-2017/).

In general,  you can determine if a feature can be abused by asking these questions:

* Could this be used to hurt someone physically?
* Could this be used to hurt someone emotionally?
* Could this be used to damage someone's reputation?
* Could this be used to communicate with someone without their consent?
* Could this be used to show something \(text, images, etc.\) to someone without their consent?
* Could this be used to learn something about a person who hasn't consented to revealing this information?
