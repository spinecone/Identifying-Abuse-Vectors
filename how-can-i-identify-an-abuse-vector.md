# How can I identify an abuse vector?

In general,  you can determine if a feature can be abused by asking these questions:

* Could this be used to hurt someone physically?
* Could this be used to hurt someone emotionally?
* Could this be used to damage someone's reputation?
* Could this be used to communicate with someone without their consent?
* Could this be used to show something \(text, images, etc.\) to someone without their consent?
* Could this be used to learn something about a person who hasn't consented to revealing this information?
