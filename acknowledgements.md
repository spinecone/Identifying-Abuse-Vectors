# Acknowledgements

Thank you to:
- RailsConf for giving me the opportunity to make my weird ideas a reality.
- The Community and Safety team at GitHub for teaching me everything I know about abuse prevention, and for being great people to work with.
- [Nate Smith](http://tilde.town/~vilmibm/) for helping me encourage a bad cat to be good, and turning my half-formed ideas into mostly-formed ones.
