The Emergency Medical Holographic program is designed to provide short-term medical assistance on starships where a full medical crew is not available. It appears as a holographic image of the program's creator.

* In an emergency, if the ship's captain is incapacitated, the EMH program can automatically promote itself to captain and take command of the ship.
